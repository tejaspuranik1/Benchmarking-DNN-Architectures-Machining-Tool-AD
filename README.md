# Benchmarking-DNN-Architectures-Machining-Tool-AD
About: 
This repository contains scripts and models for benchmarking various deep neural network architectures for machining tool anomaly detection using labeled data. This includes scripts for pre-processing data obtained from the data collection architecture (CITE ARCHITECTURE), aggregation of the data in two different formats (*per second* and *per operational sample*), implementing various deep neural network architectures for each of the two data aggregation approaches (Autoencoder, Deep Neural Network for *per second* approach and Deep Neural Network, Convolutional Network, and Residual Network for *per operational sample* approach).

An exposition of the models in this package can be found in the following paper:
